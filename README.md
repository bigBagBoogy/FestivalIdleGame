What logic should go on the blockchain and what should be in Javascript?


on the blockchain should go:
1. Topscores 
2. Progress to be saved
3. minting of monthly winner NFT's
4. Assignment of NFT's to winners

in Javascipts:
1. score keeping during game
2. upgrade effects
3. logout warning ("leave without saving progress to the blockchain?")
