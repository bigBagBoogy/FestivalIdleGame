fix fund/cheatPay function
line 84 connectWeb3.JS:
const ethAmount = document.getElementById("ethAmount").value; //string value here
connect the cheatpay button to a popup img that has 2 buttons and a close button
1 for CheatSilver and 1 for CheatGold.

# let's:

Offer 2 tiers of cheating: CheatSilver and CheatGold. Let's make these $5 and $10
These fiat amounts need to be measured against the current price of ETH/USD?
We'll write the code for this, but comment it out, since keeping track of chainlink pricefeed
funding might not be wanted.
html: button -> popup with CheatSilver and CheatGold buttons. onclick=CheatSilver()
For now we'll work off a price for ETH of $2000,
so CheatSilver = 0.0025 ETH and CheatGold = 0.005 ETH (2500000000000000 WEI and 5000000000000000)

# if needed install npm install --save-dev dotenv-webpack

totalScore (skullies) must me capped at 1e50!!!! in JS/score.js
to cap this, let's add a function that triggers at 1e50 skullies and sets all elements
to lvl10, which in term will trigger the function: levelUpStage()
podiumLvl = 1;
drinksLvl = 1;
etc, etc,
stageStartOverLvl++;

To otherwise call levelUpStage() though, we'll have to add a "checker" that looks for:
All elementsLvl = 10 to be true

look into creating ECMAScript modules. üß©

# change ABI and contract in constants.js. Now they are dummys!

Amend the FundMe contract to a cheat contract and handel "pay-to-cheat" logic.

# Importin Anvil localhost into Metamask with 10000 eth:

open metamask
click import account
in cli: `make anvil`
take a private key and paste it in metamask to import account
click import tokens
copy - paste account from cli (anvil)
symbol: eth
rpc-url: http://127
chainid: 31337

This will deploy all contracts to the "fake" hardhat localhost blockchain (chainId 31337)
Update your constants.js (in b-donate-front) with the new contract address.
In your constants.js file, update the variable contractAddress with the address of the deployed "FundMe" contract. You'll see it near the top of the hardhat output.

Connect your metamask to your local hardhat blockchain.
`PLEASE USE A METAMASK ACCOUNT THAT ISNT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY REAL MONEY.` I usually use a few different browser profiles to separate my metamasks easily.

In the output of the above command, take one of the private key accounts and import it into your metamask.

Additionally, add your localhost with chainid 31337 to your metamask.

2. open the frontend and
   Click the ‚ÄúGo Live‚Äù button at the bottom-right-hand corner of VSCode to start a server on port 5500. This will also often prompt your browser to open a new window/tab that loads your index.html file.
   If the browser doen't open then go to [a link]http://127.0.0.1:5500/

3. You can play around with the website functionality including funding, and withdrawing. The balance is logged into the console, so to see that, press cmd/ctrl + shift + i
   and then press the balance button.

If you quit this and the on a later occasion you want to do this again you will need to first open your metamask,
go to settings, --- advanced, --- and choose RESET WALLET
otherwise you will get this NONCE error in the console and the functions wont work anymore.

````MetaMask - RPC Error:
[ethjs-query] while formatting ouputs from RPC '{"value":{"code":-32603,"data":{"code":-32000,"message":"Nonce too high. Expected nonce to be 2 but got 4. Note that transactions can't be queued when automining."}}}'```

have fun!

# bug along the way to learn from:

connectWeb3.js needs to be typecasted: type="module" in it's html element and
score.js MUST not! otherwise all functions will break `undefinded`.
You can not and don't need to (if you use VAR for variables you need in both files),
do: "// import "./score.js";" in connectWeb3.js. If you do, It will call the inteval function double, with wrong arguments.

If You see this error in the browser console: `ethers-5.6.esm.min.js:16475     POST https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/69txysSR3src6m4REhIftFAI2BYyEgcN net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`
It means you're not connected to the internet!
